# Changelog

All notable changes to the PixTrail project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-03-21

This major update introduces a powerful new web interface with Flask that makes it easier than ever to visualize and share your journeys, while keeping your data private and secure.

### New Features
#### Web Interface
* Upload and process photos directly in your browser
* Visualize your routes on an interactive OpenStreetMap
* Generate and download GPX files with a single click
* Keep all your data private - nothing is uploaded to any server

#### Privacy Focused
* All processing happens completely locally on your device
* Your photos and location data never leave your computer
* No tracking, no data collection, no server uploads

#### Interactive Maps
* Dynamic route plotting on OpenStreetMap
* Markers for each photo with timestamp and location information
* Automatic map centering and zoom based on your route
* Full route line connecting all waypoints chronologically

### Improvements
#### Command Line Enhancements
* Start the web interface with a simple command: `pixtrail -w`
* Configure host and port: `pixtrail -w --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
* Control browser launch behavior: `pixtrail -w --no-browser`

## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-20

### New Features
* **Batch Processing**: Process multiple photo directories in a single command with the new batch processing feature. Perfect for photographers who want to generate GPX tracks for multiple events or trips at once.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-20

### New Features
* **Automatic GPX Naming**: GPX files are now automatically named after the photo directory. For example, if you run `pixtrail /path/to/Photos_Kyoto`, a file named `Photos_Kyoto.gpx` will be created in the same directory.

### Minor Changes
* The default filename has been changed from `track.gpx` to `PixTrail.gpx` when no explicit name can be derived.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-03-19

### Bug Fixes
* **Fixed duplicate success messages**: Removed redundant "GPX file created successfully" message that was appearing twice in terminal output

## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-19

### New Features
* **Added RAW file support**: Now supporting various RAW formats (CR2, NEF, ARW, DNG, ORF, RW2, PEF, SRW)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-19 - Initial Release

PixTrail is a Python-based tool that extracts GPS data from photo EXIF metadata and generates GPX files for mapping and route visualization.

### Features
* Extract geographical coordinates and timestamps from EXIF metadata in images
* Process individual photos or entire directories (with recursive option)
* Generate GPX files containing waypoints and tracks from your photos
* Support for various image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF)
* Command-line interface for easy integration
