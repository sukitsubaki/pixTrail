# PixTrail

**PixTrail is a simple yet powerful tool that extracts the GPS information stored in your photos' EXIF metadata and converts it into standard GPX format that can be used in various mapping applications, allowing you to visualize and share your journeys.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install with web interface
pip install pixtrail[web]

# Install with web interface (zsh/macOS)
pip install "pixtrail[web]"

# Launch web interface
pixtrail -w

# Or process photos via command line
pixtrail -i /path/to/photos
```

## The Story Behind PixTrail

> As an avid photographer, I've always enjoyed using the Photos app on iOS and macOS to organize and relive my journeys. While these tools are great for managing photos, I found myself wishing for a way to reconstruct the routes I had taken during day trips or longer journeys based on the photos I captured along the way.
>
> I wanted to see the path I wandered through a city, the trails I hiked in the mountains, or the roads I traveled during a vacation - all visualized on a map using the GPS data already embedded in my photos. This desire to connect my photographic memories with their geographic context led to the creation of PixTrail.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **GPS Data Extraction:** Extract GPS coordinates and timestamps from EXIF metadata in photos
- **Route Generation:** Create GPX files with waypoints and tracks for use in mapping applications
- **OpenStreetMap Integration:** Visualize routes directly on interactive maps

### Processing Capabilities
- **Hybrid Processing Approach:**
  - JPEG/TIFF files are processed directly in your browser for faster performance
  - RAW/PNG and other formats are processed on the server with full metadata extraction
- **Wide Format Support:**
  - Standard Formats: JPG, PNG, TIFF, BMP
  - Professional RAW Formats: CR2, NEF, ARW, ORF, RW2, PEF, SRW, DNG (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Samsung, digital negative)
- **Automated File Management:** Automatic cleanup of temporary files to save disk space

### User Interface
- **Multiple Access Methods:**
  - Command-line interface for quick scripting and batch operations
  - Web interface for browser-based visual operation
- **Advanced File Management:**
  - Directory selection with recursive processing support
  - Intuitive drag & drop interface for files and directories
  - Batch processing of multiple photo collections

### Advanced Visualization Features

- **Heat Map Visualization:** See where you spent the most time on your journey with color-coded intensity maps
- **Marker Clustering:** Group nearby photos for cleaner map displays with adjustable radius
- **Statistical Analysis:** View distance, elevation, speed, and time metrics for your journey
- **Interactive Charts:** Visualize elevation profiles and speed variations throughout your route

## Privacy

PixTrail processes all photo metadata locally on your device. No data is uploaded to any server, shared with third parties, or sent anywhere outside your computer. Your location data and photos remain completely private and under your control at all times.

When using the web interface:
- JPEG/TIFF files are processed entirely in your browser - only extracted GPS coordinates are sent to the local server
- RAW/PNG files are temporarily cached (local) during processing and automatically deleted afterward
- Only the generated GPX files are stored (local)

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install pixtrail
```

### Installation with Web Interface

```bash
# For bash, PowerShell, or Command Prompt
pip install pixtrail[web]

# For zsh (macOS default shell)
pip install "pixtrail[web]"
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sukitsubaki/pixtrail.git
cd pixtrail
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Basic usage
pixtrail -i /path/to/photos

# Specify output file
pixtrail -i /path/to/photos -o /path/to/output.gpx

# Search recursively in subdirectories
pixtrail -i /path/to/photos -r

# Enable verbose output
pixtrail -i /path/to/photos -v

# Batch process multiple directories
pixtrail -b /path/to/photos1 /path/to/photos2 /path/to/photos3

# Batch process with a common output directory
pixtrail -b /path/to/photos1 /path/to/photos2 -d /path/to/gpx_output

# Start the web interface
pixtrail -w

# Start the web interface on a specific host and port
pixtrail -w --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# Start the web interface without automatically opening a browser
pixtrail -w --no-browser
```

### Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to upload photos, extract GPS data, visualize routes on a map, and download GPX files:

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/pixtrail-web-interface.png" alt="PixTrail Web Interface" width="100%">
</div>

1. Start the web interface:
   ```bash
   pixtrail -w
   ```

2. Your browser will automatically open to the PixTrail interface
3. Select photos using one of the following methods:
   - Click "Select Photos" to choose individual files
   - Click "Select Directory" to choose an entire folder
   - Drag and drop images directly into the interface
4. For directory processing, you can enable recursive subdirectory scanning
5. PixTrail will process the photos and display the route on a map
6. Use the map controls to:
   - Toggle the heatmap to visualize dwell time
   - Enable clustering for better visibility of dense photo areas
   - View statistics and charts for distance, elevation, and speed
7. Download the GPX file for use in other applications

### Python API

```python
from pixtrail.core import PixTrail

# Create a PixTrail object
pt = PixTrail()

# Process a directory of images
gps_data = pt.process_directory("/path/to/photos", recursive=True)

# Generate a GPX file
pt.generate_gpx("/path/to/output.gpx")

# Or do both in one step
pt.process_and_generate("/path/to/photos", "/path/to/output.gpx", recursive=True)
```

## Example Workflow

Here's a practical example of using PixTrail to document a hiking trip:

1. **Take photos** during your hike with a GPS-enabled camera or smartphone
2. **Transfer photos** to your computer into a folder (e.g., "Mountain_Hike")
3. **Process photos** using PixTrail:
   ```bash
   pixtrail -i ~/Photos/Mountain_Hike
   ```
4. **View the results**:
   - A GPX file named "Mountain_Hike.gpx" is created in the same directory
   - Or use the web interface for interactive visualization: `pixtrail -w`
5. **Use the GPX file**:
   - Import into Google Earth to see your route in 3D
   - Upload to hiking platforms like AllTrails or Strava
   - Share with friends or use in blog posts about your adventure

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- exifread
- gpxpy
- Pillow

- Chart.js (automatically included in web interface)

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate is the GPS data from photos?</b></summary>
The accuracy depends on your camera or smartphone's GPS capabilities. Most modern smartphones provide accuracy within 5-10 meters under good conditions. Professional cameras with built-in GPS may vary in accuracy. PixTrail extracts the data exactly as recorded in your photos' EXIF metadata.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use photos without GPS data?</b></summary>
PixTrail requires photos with GPS coordinates in their EXIF metadata. Photos without this data will be skipped during processing. Most smartphones automatically embed GPS data when location services are enabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does PixTrail handle large photo collections?</b></summary>
PixTrail is designed to efficiently process large collections. For very large sets (1000+ photos), the batch processing mode allows you to process multiple directories sequentially. The clustering feature in the web interface helps visualize dense collections by grouping nearby photos.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I customize the generated GPX files?</b></summary>
Basic customization is available through command-line options. For advanced customization, you can use the Python API to process the GPS data and create custom GPX files with specific attributes.
</details>
