# PixTrail Development Guide

This section provides information for developers who want to understand, modify, or extend PixTrail. It covers the architecture, module structure, and best practices for development.

## Architecture Overview

PixTrail uses a modular architecture designed for:

- **Maintainability**: Separate modules with clear responsibilities
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without modifying core code
- **Reusability**: Common utilities shared across features
- **Testability**: Isolated components that can be tested individually

For a detailed overview of the architecture, see the [Architecture Document](../architecture.md).

## Module Structure

The JavaScript code is organized into a hierarchy of modules:

- **Main Application** (`main.js`) - Application entry point and controller
- **API Client** (`api/apiClient.js`) - Server communication
- **Feature Modules** (`modules/*.js`) - Encapsulated feature implementations
- **Utility Functions** (`utils/*.js`) - Shared helper functions

The [Module Structure](module-structure.md) document provides detailed information on how these modules are organized and interact.

## CSS Architecture

Similarly, the CSS is organized into modular components:

- **Base Styles** - Reset, typography, and variables
- **Layout Styles** - Page structure and grid system
- **Module Styles** - Component-specific styles

Learn more in the [CSS Architecture](css-architecture.md) document.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Start the development server
4. Make changes
5. Test your changes
6. Submit a pull request

### Testing

All code should be tested before submission. See the [Testing Guide](testing.md) for details on how to test your changes.

### Documentation

When adding new features or modifying existing ones, be sure to update the relevant documentation. Documentation should be kept in sync with the code.

## Extending PixTrail

### Adding New Features

New features should be implemented as modules that integrate with the existing architecture. The [Extending Modules Tutorial](../tutorials/extending-modules.md) provides a step-by-step guide to creating new modules.

### Modifying Existing Features

When modifying existing features, follow these guidelines:

1. Understand the current implementation
2. Make minimal changes to achieve your goal
3. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
4. Update tests and documentation

### Creating Custom Themes

PixTrail uses CSS variables for theming. To create a custom theme:

1. Create a new CSS file with your variable definitions
2. Include it after the main CSS file
3. Override the desired variables

## Common Development Tasks

### Working with GPS Data

GPS data is handled by the `gpsUtils.js` module, which provides functions for:

- Converting between coordinate formats
- Calculating distances and speeds
- Validating coordinates
- Computing route statistics

### Processing Photos

Photos are processed using the `exifReader.js` module, which extracts EXIF metadata from images.

### Map Visualization

The map visualization is handled by the `mapVisualization.js` module, which wraps Leaflet.js functionality.

## Best Practices

- **Module Design**: Follow the single responsibility principle
- **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare dependencies via imports
- **State Management**: Keep state within modules when possible
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors and edge cases
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications, especially for large data sets
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI components are accessible
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test in different browsers and devices
