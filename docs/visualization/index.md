# Visualization Features

PixTrail offers several powerful visualization features to help you understand and analyze your journeys. These features are available in the web interface and provide different ways to view and interact with your photo location data.

## Overview

The visualization features in PixTrail include:

1. **Basic Route Mapping**: View your photo locations as markers on an interactive map
2. **Heat Maps**: Visualize where you spent the most time during your journey
3. **Marker Clustering**: Group nearby photos for cleaner map displays
4. **Route Statistics**: View detailed metrics about your journey
5. **Interactive Charts**: Visualize elevation profiles and speed variations

## Basic Route Mapping

After processing your photos, PixTrail will display a map showing:

- Markers for each photo location
- A line connecting the markers in chronological order (when timestamps are available)
- Pop-up information when clicking on markers, including:
  - Photo name
  - Coordinates
  - Timestamp (when available)
  - Altitude (when available)

The map is based on OpenStreetMap and provides standard map controls:
- Zoom in/out using buttons or mouse wheel
- Pan by clicking and dragging
- Reset view to show the entire route

## Map Controls

The map interface includes several controls to enhance your visualization experience:

- **Show/Hide Heatmap**: Toggle the heat map overlay
- **Enable/Disable Clustering**: Toggle marker clustering
- **Show/Hide Statistics**: Show/hide the statistics panel
- **Download GPX**: Download the generated GPX file
- **Clear Data**: Remove all loaded data and reset the interface

## Advanced Visualization Features

### Heat Maps

The [heat map feature](heatmap.md) visualizes where you spent the most time during your journey by creating a color-coded overlay on the map. Areas with higher intensity (red/yellow) indicate more photos or longer time spent at that location, while areas with lower intensity (blue/green) indicate fewer photos or shorter visits.


Heat maps are particularly useful for:
- Identifying the focal points of your journey
- Discovering patterns in your travel behavior
- Highlighting areas of particular interest
- Visualizing density patterns across large datasets

Learn more in the [Heat Maps](heatmap.md) documentation.

### Marker Clustering

The [marker clustering feature](clustering.md) helps manage routes with many photos by grouping nearby markers into clusters. This keeps the map clean and navigable, even with hundreds of photo locations.


Marker clustering offers several benefits:
- Reduces visual clutter when dealing with many photos
- Improves map performance by reducing the number of visible markers
- Provides a better overview of your journey
- Allows dynamic exploration by clicking on clusters to zoom in

Learn more in the [Marker Clustering](clustering.md) documentation.

### Route Statistics and Charts

The [statistics feature](statistics.md) provides detailed metrics about your journey, including:

- Total distance traveled
- Duration of your journey
- Average and maximum speeds
- Elevation data (minimum, maximum, total gain)
- Photo count

The statistics panel also includes interactive charts:
- **Elevation Profile**: Visualizes altitude changes throughout your journey
- **Speed Profile**: Shows speed variations between photo locations

These charts help you understand the physical aspects of your journey, such as challenging climbs during a hike or varying speeds during a road trip.

Learn more in the [Statistics and Charts](statistics.md) documentation.

## Using Visualization Features Together

PixTrail's visualization features can be combined to gain deeper insights:

### Combined Example: City Tour Analysis

For a city tour:
- **Basic map** shows the overall route through the city
- **Clustering** groups photos taken at the same landmark
- **Heat map** highlights where you spent the most time (museums, landmarks)
- **Statistics** reveal how far you walked and how long the tour took

### Combined Example: Hiking Trip Visualization

For a hiking trip:
- **Basic map** shows the trail route
- **Elevation chart** reveals the challenging sections with steep climbs
- **Speed chart** correlates with difficulty (slower in steep sections)
- **Heat map** identifies rest stops and viewpoints where you took multiple photos

### Combined Example: Road Trip Documentation

For a road trip:
- **Basic map** shows the entire journey across multiple locations
- **Clustering** organizes photos by location/stop
- **Statistics** provide total distance and travel time
- **Speed chart** distinguishes between highway travel and local exploration

## Best Practices for Effective Visualization

To get the most out of PixTrail's visualization features:

1. **Choose the right visualization for your purpose**:
   - Use the basic map for a simple overview
   - Add clustering when working with many photos
   - Enable the heat map to identify key locations
   - Use statistics to understand quantitative aspects

2. **Adjust settings for your specific data**:
   - Use a smaller cluster radius for dense urban areas
   - Use a larger cluster radius for sparse rural journeys
   - Zoom in for detailed exploration of specific areas
   - Zoom out for a broader overview

3. **Interpret visualizations in context**:
   - Heat intensity may indicate interest or simply waiting time
   - Clusters don't always represent intentional stops
   - Speed variations may be due to traffic or intentional pauses
   - Elevation data depends on the accuracy of your camera's GPS

4. **Compare different journeys**:
   - Process multiple journeys and compare their statistics
   - Look for patterns in your travel behavior across different trips
   - Compare similar journeys (e.g., different hikes on the same trail)

## Technical Details

PixTrail's visualization features are built using the following technologies:

- **Maps**: Leaflet.js for interactive mapping
- **Heat Maps**: Leaflet.heat plugin for heat map visualization
- **Clustering**: Leaflet.markercluster plugin for marker clustering
- **Charts**: Chart.js for interactive charts
- **GPS Data**: Processed from the EXIF metadata in your photos

All visualization processing happens locally in your browser, ensuring your data remains private.
